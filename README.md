# PacMan project

You will find :
 - Pacman.jar which is the executable of our programm
 - a folder "javadoc" with all the javadoc
 - a folder "src" with classes and interfaces of our program listed in three packages (View, Logic et Data)

To run the program you can either launch it by clicking on "Pacman.jar" or you can launch it with the command "bash build.sh" 
(you have to be at the root of the main folder).
